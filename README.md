# Digital Canvas
Modeled after a popular childhood toy, users employ simple mouse movements or taps to transform a plain white canvas into a dazzling work of art.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

With either the tap of a finger or the movement of the cursor, the cells turn darker and darker until completely black. Then the cells reset to white, and the process begins all over again. The size of the cells is adjustable via the slider, and you can reset the canvas by clicking the "CLEAR" button.

## Optimizations

Advanced features would include a color selection, drawing mode (click or drag), toggling grid lines, and applying an optional blur effect.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to use simple math to both build the grid and implement the shading increments.

## Examples
Take a look at this example that I have in my own portfolio:
