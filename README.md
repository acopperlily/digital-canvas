## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The grid is made up of tiny divs that change to a slightly darker shade of gray until it is entirely black.

## Optimizations

Instead of an alert, I'd like to build a spinner or a range slider to change the size of the grid.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use simple math to both build the grid and implement the color increments.

## Examples:
Take a look at this example that I have in my own portfolio:
